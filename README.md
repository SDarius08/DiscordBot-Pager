# Discord-Bot
## Background:
This bot was made for a discord server with friends, where in a roleplay situation it was needed for actions and pinging the respective role. 

## Problems that occured:
+ Pinging the roles
+ Having a unique identifier for each ping
+ Implementing the new Discord.js slash commands
+ Implementing access level actions

## Installation and Setup Instructions
Technologies needed: <code>NODE.js</code> and <code>NPM</code>

Create a dot.env file with the content:

<code>TOKEN: "BOT_TOKEN.API"
CLIENT_ID: "DISCORD_ID"
GUILD_ID:"DISCORD_SERVER_ID
MONGO_DB: "MONGO_DB_SERVER_TOKEN
</code>

Installation:

<code> npm -i </code>

Run the bot:

<code> npm index.js </code>

## Reflection
This bot was a personal challenge given by my friends to help them experience a more "real" game in a roleplay situation. While doing the project it took me through new problems as understanding their necessity for the bot and the features they wanted and maintaining technical support as they used it more.

A big challenge I had was working with the new Discord.js slash command feature and then changing my view over the commands. To get over it, I needed the-and-error method, making me use more documentation than was available to read.

Overall, it was an interesting project that helped me to learn more about NODE.js and its power.
